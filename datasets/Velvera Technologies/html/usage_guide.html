<h3 id="donts">DON’Ts</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Don’t Use Third-Party Fast Chargers</strong><br />
Avoid using non-certified high-wattage chargers. This may <strong>void
your warranty</strong> and cause internal damage.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Don’t Jailbreak or Root Devices</strong><br />
Modifying VelveraOS disables key security features and
<strong>invalidates all warranty and Care+ protection
plans</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Don’t Ignore Overheating or Swelling</strong><br />
Discontinue use and <strong>immediately contact support</strong> if you
notice battery swelling, overheating, or performance drops.</p></li>

Use only trusted sources (Velvera Store, Google Play) to avoid security
risks and data compromise.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Don’t Expose to Water Beyond Rated Depth</strong><br />
Even with IP68/IP69K ratings, <strong>avoid prolonged water
submersion</strong>, especially in salt water or soapy
environments.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Don’t Disassemble Your Device</strong><br />
DIY repairs or tampering with internals will <strong>void your
warranty</strong> and may cause further damage.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Don’t Delay Warranty Claims</strong><br />
Initiate warranty claims promptly. Devices showing <strong>signs of
neglect or post-damage usage</strong> may be rejected.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Don’t Share Your Velvera ID Credentials</strong><br />
Your Velvera ID gives access to cloud services, backups, and AI features
— keep it secure and enable 2FA.</p></li>
