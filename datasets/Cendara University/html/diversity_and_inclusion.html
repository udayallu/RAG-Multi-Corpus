University Diversity and Inclusion Statement</h1>
<h2 id="commitment-to-equity">Commitment to Equity</h2>
<p>Cendara University is steadfast in its dedication to nurturing an
academic community where equity, access, and belonging are woven into
the fabric of campus life. Our commitment goes beyond compliance; it is
an enduring pledge to champion fairness, confront barriers to
opportunity, and assure that every community member is empowered to
thrive.</p>
<p>From its inception, Cendara University has viewed diversity as
integral to academic excellence and institutional vitality. The adoption
of the <em>Inclusivity Pact</em> in 1985 solidified our role as a leader
among regional universities in fostering equity. The Pact mandates
ongoing evaluation and action in the following areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Equitable recruitment, retention, and advancement of students,
faculty, and staff from underrepresented groups.</li>
<li>Active identification and removal of institutional barriers.</li>
<li>Comprehensive support systems to enable personal and academic
achievement for all.</li>
<li>Transparent and inclusive policy development that reflects a range
of perspectives.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our Office of Diversity Initiatives, now in operation for nearly four
decades, coordinates these efforts in collaboration with all colleges,
research centers, and administrative units.</p>
