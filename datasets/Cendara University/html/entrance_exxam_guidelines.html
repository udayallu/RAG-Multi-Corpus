Entrance Exam Information</h1>
<hr />
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Cendara University administers entrance examinations for select
undergraduate and graduate academic programs to ensure a high standard
of academic readiness and to appropriately place students in courses
aligned with their skill levels. While most degree programs do not
require a standardized university-wide entrance exam, certain
competitive majors, specialized scholarship pathways, and direct-entry
professional tracks require subject-based or aptitude testing.</p>
<p>Students are encouraged to review this section thoroughly and consult
with their academic advisor or the Office of Admissions to determine
whether an entrance exam applies to their intended course of study.</p>
