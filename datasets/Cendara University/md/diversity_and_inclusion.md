# Cendara University Diversity and Inclusion Statement

## Commitment to Equity

Cendara University is steadfast in its dedication to nurturing an academic community where equity, access, and belonging are woven into the fabric of campus life. Our commitment goes beyond compliance; it is an enduring pledge to champion fairness, confront barriers to opportunity, and assure that every community member is empowered to thrive.

From its inception, Cendara University has viewed diversity as integral to academic excellence and institutional vitality. The adoption of the *Inclusivity Pact* in 1985 solidified our role as a leader among regional universities in fostering equity. The Pact mandates ongoing evaluation and action in the following areas:

- Equitable recruitment, retention, and advancement of students, faculty, and staff from underrepresented groups.
- Active identification and removal of institutional barriers.
- Comprehensive support systems to enable personal and academic achievement for all.
- Transparent and inclusive policy development that reflects a range of perspectives.

Our Office of Diversity Initiatives, now in operation for nearly four decades, coordinates these efforts in collaboration with all colleges, research centers, and administrative units.
