# Opening and Closing the Boot

## Opening the Boot

There are several ways you can open the boot (trunk) of your Aventro vehicle, depending on the model and features equipped:

### 1. **Manual Release (Lever/Button)**
- Locate the boot release lever or button inside the vehicle.  
  - Usually found near the driver’s seat or on the driver’s side door panel.
- Pull the lever or press the button.  
  - You’ll hear a click indicating the boot is unlocked.
- Go to the rear of the vehicle and lift the boot lid upwards to open.

### 2. **Remote Key Fob**
- Press and hold the boot release button on your vehicle’s remote key fob.
- The boot will unlock and, on some models, may open slightly for you to lift.

### 3. **Exterior Button or Handle**
- With the vehicle unlocked, press the soft-touch button or lift the handle located just above the number plate or under the boot lid.
- Lift the boot gently to open.

### 4. **Hands-Free Option (If Equipped)**
- With the key fob in your possession, stand behind the boot and make a gentle kicking motion under the center of the rear bumper (sensor area).
- Wait for a few seconds; the boot will unlatch automatically. Lift to open.

> If the boot does not open or close properly, check if the vehicle is in ‘Valet Mode’ or if the child safety lock for the boot is engaged. For electrically operated boots, ensure the battery has sufficient charge.
