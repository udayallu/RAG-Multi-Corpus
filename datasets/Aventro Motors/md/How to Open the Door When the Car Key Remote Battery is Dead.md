## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. **Locate the Physical Key**
- Most Aventro car key fobs have a hidden physical key.
- Look for a **release button or switch** on your remote.
- Slide or press the release to pull out the mechanical key from the remote.

### 2. **Find the Key Slot on Your Car**
- **Some models:** The physical key slot is exposed and visible near the driver's door handle.
- **Other models:** The key slot might be **hidden under a cover** on the door handle. Look for a small indent or slot.
    - Gently pry off the cover (if applicable) using the physical key or your fingernail.

### 3. **Insert and Turn the Key**
- Insert the physical key into the keyhole.
- Turn the key (usually clockwise) to unlock the door manually.

## Additional Notes
- **Alarm:** Some cars may trigger the alarm when opened manually. Don’t worry—once inside, place the key fob near the start/ignition button (if using push start) or insert it into the ignition to recognize the key and disarm the alarm.
- **Replace Remote Battery:** As soon as possible, replace the battery in your key remote to restore full functionality.
- For help, visit your nearest [Aventro Service Center](#service-center-locations) or call Aventro Motors at **+91 124 1234567**.
