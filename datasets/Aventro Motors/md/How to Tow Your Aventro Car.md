## **Before You Begin**

- **Check Owner’s Manual:** Refer to your specific model's owner’s manual for any towing restrictions or recommendations.

- Torch (for visibility at night)
- Warning triangle or cones

## **Step 2: Locate the Tow Hook Covers**

1. **Front and Rear Bumper:**  
   - Look for small plastic covers on the bumper (often marked by a tow symbol).
2. **Remove the Cover:**  
   - Use a plastic pry tool or key to open the cover.

## **Step 3: Attach the Tow Hook**

1. **Retrieve the Tow Hook:**  
   - Found in your car’s tool kit or trunk.
2. **Screw in the Tow Hook:**

## **Step 4: Connect the Tow Strap or Tow Rope**

  Place in Neutral (N), release the parking brake.  
  **CAUTION:** For automatics and hybrids, flatbed towing is recommended to avoid transmission damage.
