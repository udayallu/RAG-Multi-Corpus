# Best Ways to Maintain Good Mileage

Achieving and maintaining good mileage is essential for saving fuel costs, reducing environmental impact, and ensuring your vehicle’s long-term health. Whether you drive a petrol, diesel, hybrid, or electric car from Aventro Motors, the following practices will help you get the most out of every journey.

---

## 1. Regular Maintenance

- **Follow Service Schedules:** Stick to the manufacturer's recommended service intervals for oil changes, air filter replacements, and other checks.
- **Use Genuine Parts:** Always use genuine Aventro spare parts for optimal performance (e.g., Air Filter, Spark Plug, Oil Filter).

## 2. Check Tyre Pressure

- **Maintain Proper Pressure:** Under-inflated tyres increase rolling resistance and decrease mileage.
- **Check Regularly:** Inspect tyre pressure at least once a month and before long trips.

## 3. Drive Smoothly

- **Avoid Sudden Acceleration or Braking:** Rapid changes waste fuel and energy.
- **Use Gentle Throttle Inputs:** Gradual acceleration and deceleration help maximize efficiency.

## 4. Limit Idling

- **Turn Off Engine at Long Stops:** Idling consumes fuel needlessly in petrol/diesel vehicles.
- **Use Start-Stop Feature If Equipped:** Many Aventro models have this for additional savings.

## 5. Reduce Excess Weight

- **Remove Unnecessary Items:** Extra load in the boot or cabin means more work for your engine.
- **Avoid Unused Racks:** Roof boxes or roof racks can reduce aerodynamic efficiency.

## 6. Monitor Battery Health (For Hybrids & Electrics)

- **Regular Battery Checks:** Ensure the battery pack is in good health to maximize the range.
- **Use Fast Charging Sparingly:** Reserve fast-charging for emergencies to prolong battery life.

## 7. Use the Right Fuel & Lubricants

- **Recommended Grade:** Always use the manufacturer-recommended fuel and lubricants for your vehicle.
- **High-Quality Products:** Inferior products can harm efficiency and engine health.

## 8. Maintain Alignment and Suspension

- **Wheel Alignment:** Misaligned wheels can drag and reduce mileage.
- **Suspension Health:** Worn-out suspension components (like Shock Absorbers) affect efficiency.

## 9. Use Air Conditioning Wisely

- **AC Usage:** Use Air Conditioning only when necessary as it can put extra load on the engine.
- **Ventilation First:** Try ventilation on cooler days instead of AC.

## 10. Smart Driving Habits

- **Maintain Steady Speeds:** Use cruise control on highways if available.
- **Plan Routes:** Avoid congested routes which lead to excessive stop-start driving.
