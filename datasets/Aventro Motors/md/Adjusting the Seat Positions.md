## Steps for Adjusting the Seat Positions

### 1. **Adjusting the Seat Distance from the Pedals**
- Locate the seat adjustment lever under the front edge of the seat.
- Pull the lever up to unlock the seat.
- Slide the seat forward or backward until your feet reach the pedals comfortably while keeping a slight bend at your knees.
- Release the lever to lock the seat in position.
- Gently rock the seat to ensure it is securely locked.

### 2. **Adjusting the Seat Height (if equipped)**
- Locate the seat height adjustment lever or electronic control (usually on the side of the seat).
- For manual systems, pump the lever up or down.
- For electronic systems, use the corresponding switch to raise or lower the seat.
- Adjust until you have a clear view over the steering wheel and dashboard, with adequate headspace.

### 3. **Adjusting the Seat Backrest Angle**
- Find the seat backrest adjustment lever or rotary knob at the side of the seat.
- Lean forward slightly and pull or rotate the control to release the backrest.
- Adjust the backrest angle so you are sitting upright, with your shoulders touching the seatback.
- The ideal angle is slightly reclined for comfort, but never more than 30° from upright.
- Ensure the backrest is firmly locked in position before driving.

### 4. **Adjusting the Headrest**
- Hold both sides of the headrest.
- Press the adjustment button (usually at the base) and move the headrest up or down.
- The top of the headrest should be level with the top of your head.
- The headrest should be as close to the back of your head as possible for optimal safety.

### 5. **Adjusting the Lumbar Support (if equipped)**
- Use the lumbar support lever, dial, or electronic switch (side of seatback).
- Increase or decrease support as needed for comfort and spine alignment.
- Proper lumbar support helps reduce fatigue on long drives.
