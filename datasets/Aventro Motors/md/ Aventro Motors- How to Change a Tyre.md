## Steps to Change a Tyre

### 1. Park Safely

- Pull over to a safe, flat location away from traffic.
- Turn on your hazard lights.
- Apply the handbrake.
- Place wheel wedges/blocks (if available) to prevent vehicle movement.

### 2. Gather Tools

You will need:
- Spare tyre (found as per table above)
- Jack (usually in toolkit)
- Lug wrench (in toolkit)
- Wheel wedges/blocks (optional)
- Vehicle owner's manual (for reference)

### 3. Remove the Wheel Cover/Hubcap
- If your wheel has a cover, use the flat end of the wrench or the provided lever to gently pry it off.

### 4. Loosen the Lug Nuts
- Use the lug wrench to turn the lug nuts counter-clockwise.
- Loosen them slightly – do not remove fully at this stage.

### 5. Lift the Vehicle with the Jack

- Position the jack under the jacking point nearest to the flat tyre. Refer to your owner’s manual for the exact point.
- Raise the vehicle until the flat tyre is about 6 inches above the ground.

### 6. Remove the Lug Nuts and Tyre

- Unscrew the lug nuts completely.
- Remove the flat tyre and set it aside.

### 7. Mount the Spare Tyre

- Line up the holes and push the spare onto the hub.
- Replace the lug nuts and tighten them by hand.

### 8. Lower the Vehicle

- Carefully lower the car with the jack until the tyre touches the ground firmly.
- Remove the jack.

### 9. Tighten the Lug Nuts

- Use the lug wrench to tighten the lug nuts in a star pattern to ensure even pressure.

### 10. Replace the Hubcap or Wheel Cover (if applicable)

- Place the hubcap back onto the wheel.

### 11. Stow Equipment
