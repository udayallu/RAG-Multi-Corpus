## 1. **Check the Basics**
- **Gear Position:** Ensure the car is in 'Park' (automatic) or 'Neutral' (manual).
- **Steering Lock:** Gently turn the steering wheel while turning the key if steering is locked.
- **Key/Start Button:** Switch ignition off and retry. For push-button start, press brake/clutch while starting.

## 2. **Battery Check**
- **Symptoms:** No lights/display, slow/absent cranking sounds, clicking noise.
- **Actions:**
    - Inspect dashboard for dim or no lights.
    - Try using headlights or infotainment; if dim or off, battery may be the culprit.
    - If available, try jump-starting with a healthy battery.
    - For Electric variants: Ensure Battery Pack has adequate charge. Attempt Fast Charging if possible.

## 3. **Fuel System Inspection**
- **Low Fuel/Empty Tank:** Check fuel gauge and fill if necessary.

## 4. **Starter Motor & Electricals**
- **Symptoms:** Single click or silence, even with good battery.
- **Actions:**
    - Check for blown fuses (refer to user manual location).
    - Test if interior lights stay bright when key is turned; if yes, suspect starter relay/motor.

## 5. **Check Engine Warning Lights**
- **Look for:** Engine/Malfunction lights on dashboard.
- **Action:** If warning lights appear, note down symbol/color for service personnel.

## 6. **Listen for Sounds**

- **Engine Cranking (but not starting):** Possible fuel, ignition, or electrical problems.
