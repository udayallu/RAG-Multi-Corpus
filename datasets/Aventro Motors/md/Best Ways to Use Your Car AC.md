# Best Ways to Use Your Car AC in All Seasons  
*For Aventro Motors Car Owners*

Your vehicle’s air conditioning (AC) system is vital for comfort and safety throughout the year. Whether it’s cooling in summer, defogging in monsoon, or maintaining a pleasant environment in winter, knowing how to use the AC efficiently will extend system life and enhance your driving experience. Here’s a guide to making the most of your AC system during every season.

## Summer: Beat the Heat

**1. Ventilate First**  
- Before switching on the AC, roll down the windows and drive for a couple of minutes to expel hot air.  
- This makes the cabin cool down faster.

**2. Use Recirculation Mode**  
- Turn on the AC and set it to “recirculate” once the cabin is cool.
- This prevents hot outside air from entering, making the system more effective.

**3. Set the Right Temperature**  
- Avoid setting the thermostat to the lowest setting. 22-24°C (72-75°F) is usually comfortable and easier on the compressor.

**4. Regular Maintenance**  
- Clean or replace the cabin air filter.
- Get your AC system inspected and refrigerant topped up at an Aventro Service Center before summer starts.

## Monsoon: Fight Humidity and Fog

**1. Use AC for Defogging**  
- Turn on the AC with the blower directed at the windshield to quickly clear fog.
- Use the “fresh air” mode for a few minutes to reduce internal humidity.

**2. Don’t Use Recirculate Mode Continuously**  
- Constant recirculation during rains may increase humidity inside, causing more fogging.

**3. Keep Windows Closed**  
- Prevent water and more humidity from entering the cabin.

## Winter: Comfort with Care

**1. Run the AC Regularly**  
- Turn on the AC for at least 10 minutes once a week, even in winter.  
- This keeps seals lubricated and prevents mold in the system.

**2. Use AC with Heater for Defogging**  
- Warm air alone may not clear the windshield.  
- Use the AC and heater together (AC dries the air, heater warms it) for effective demisting.
