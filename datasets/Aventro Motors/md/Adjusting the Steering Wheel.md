## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Park the Vehicle Safely
- Ensure the vehicle is on a flat surface and engage the parking brake.
- Turn off the engine for safety.

### 2. Locate the Adjustment Lever
- Look for the steering adjustment lever beneath or on the side of the steering column, usually beneath the wheel.

### 3. Release the Lever
- Pull (or push, depending on the model) the adjustment lever to unlock the steering wheel movement.

### 4. Adjust the Steering Wheel
- **Tilt:** Move the wheel up or down to a comfortable height.
- **Telescopic:** Pull the wheel towards you or push it away to set a comfortable distance.
- The steering wheel should not obstruct your view of the gauges.

### 5. Lock the Steering Wheel Position
- Once set, firmly push the adjustment lever back to the locked position.

### 6. Check Positioning
- With your back against the seat, extend your arms and rest your wrists on top of the wheel; your elbows should be slightly bent.
- Ensure there is at least 25 cm (10 inches) between your chest and the wheel (important for airbag safety).
- Confirm that all indicator lights and gauges are fully visible.

## Tips

- Adjust your seat first before the steering wheel.
- If your vehicle has a heated steering wheel or steering wheel memory settings, consult your owner's manual for additional features.
- Never adjust the steering wheel while driving.

## Troubleshooting

- **Stuck Lever:** Check for obstructions under/around the lever or consult your nearest Aventro Service Center.
