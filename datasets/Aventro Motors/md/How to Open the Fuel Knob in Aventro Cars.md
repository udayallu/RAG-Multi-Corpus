     - In some models, it may be on the dashboard or central console.

   - Pull up or push the lever labelled with a **fuel pump icon**.
   - You may hear a click indicating the fuel lid has been released.

4. **Exit the Car**

## Additional Tips

- **If the Fuel Lid Doesn’t Open:** Ensure the car is unlocked; some models require all doors to be unlocked before the lever works.
- **Never Force the Cap:** If the knob is stuck, double-check that the release mechanism is fully engaged.
- **Electric & Hybrid Models:** Always check specific instructions in the owner's manual for high-voltage safety precautions.
