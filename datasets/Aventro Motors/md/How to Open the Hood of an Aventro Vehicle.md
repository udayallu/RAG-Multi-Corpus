# How to Open the Hood of an Aventro Vehicle

Opening the hood of your Aventro car is a simple process that gives you access to the engine compartment for checks and maintenance. Follow these steps:

## Steps to Open the Hood

1. **Park the Car Safely**
    - Ensure your car is parked on a level surface.
    - Turn off the engine and engage the parking brake.

2. **Locate the Hood Release Lever**
    - The hood release lever is usually located under the dashboard, to the right or left of the driver’s seat (near the footwell).
    - Look for a lever with a hood icon (it may show a car with an open hood).

3. **Pull the Hood Release Lever**
    - Pull the lever firmly. You should hear a slight click as the hood pops up a little.

4. **Move to the Front of the Car**
    - Go to the front of the vehicle.
    - The hood will now be slightly raised.

5. **Find the Secondary Latch**
    - Slide your hand under the center front edge of the hood.
    - Feel for the secondary latch (usually a small lever or tab).
    - Push or slide the latch to one side to release the hood completely.

6. **Lift the Hood**
    - Lift the hood open.
    - (Some models may have hydraulic struts; if not, locate the prop rod and secure the hood in the open position.)

7. **Secure the Hood**
    - If your model uses a prop rod:
        1. Find the prop rod and insert it into the designated slot on the underside of the hood.
    - For hoods with hydraulic struts, the hood will stay open automatically.

## Closing the Hood

1. **Remove the Prop Rod** (if applicable) and place it back into its holder.
2. **Lower the Hood Gently** to about 30 cm (1 foot) above the latch, then allow it to drop shut.
3. **Check it is Securely Latched** by pressing gently on the front edge—do not slam.

## Safety Tips

- Never open the hood while the car is moving.
- Allow engine components to cool before touching.
- Always ensure the hood is closed securely before driving.

**For any difficulties or if the hood does not open as expected, refer to your Aventro Owner’s Manual or visit your nearest Aventro Service Center.**
