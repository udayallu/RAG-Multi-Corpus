## Don’ts

### 1. **Don’t Compromise Vehicle Warranty**
- Installing uncertified or incompatible accessories can void your company warranty—consult Aventro first!
- Never bypass or disable factory safety features (like airbags, sensors, anti-theft systems).

### 2. **Don’t Use Low-Cost, Sub-Standard Parts**
- Avoid cheap, uncertified or counterfeit electrical accessories—they can cause malfunction, fire, or permanent damage.

### 3. **Don’t Overload the Electrical System**
- Never install accessories (high-powered audio, extra lights, etc.) that draw excessive power without proper upgrades (e.g., alternator, wiring).

### 4. **Don’t Attempt DIY Installation for Complex Accessories**
- Never attempt to install complex electrical or electronic components yourself unless you’re certified.
- Avoid modifying or cutting factory wires, as this can cause electrical faults.

### 5. **Don’t Ignore Warning Signs After Installation**
- If you notice dashboard warnings, flickering lights, or malfunctioning electronics post-installation, stop using the accessory immediately and consult a service center.

### 6. **Don’t Block Airbags or Sensors**
- Never install accessories (phone holders, seat covers, dashboards gadgets) that block airbags, seat belt pre-tensioners, or sensors.

### 7. **Don’t Forget Insurance Implications**
- Inform your insurer if you add any expensive or electrical accessories—undisclosed modifications may impact future claims.
