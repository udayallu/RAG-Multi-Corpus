Mileage</h1>
<p>Achieving and maintaining good mileage is essential for saving fuel
costs, reducing environmental impact, and ensuring your vehicle’s
long-term health. Whether you drive a petrol, diesel, hybrid, or
electric car from Aventro Motors, the following practices will help you
get the most out of every journey.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="regular-maintenance">1. Regular Maintenance</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Follow Service Schedules:</strong> Stick to the
manufacturer’s recommended service intervals for oil changes, air filter
replacements, and other checks.</li>
<li><strong>Use Genuine Parts:</strong> Always use genuine Aventro spare
parts for optimal performance (e.g., Air Filter, Spark Plug, Oil
Filter).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="check-tyre-pressure">2. Check Tyre Pressure</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Maintain Proper Pressure:</strong> Under-inflated tyres
increase rolling resistance and decrease mileage.</li>
<li><strong>Check Regularly:</strong> Inspect tyre pressure at least
once a month and before long trips.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="drive-smoothly">3. Drive Smoothly</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Avoid Sudden Acceleration or Braking:</strong> Rapid changes
waste fuel and energy.</li>
<li><strong>Use Gentle Throttle Inputs:</strong> Gradual acceleration
and deceleration help maximize efficiency.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="limit-idling">4. Limit Idling</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Turn Off Engine at Long Stops:</strong> Idling consumes fuel
needlessly in petrol/diesel vehicles.</li>
<li><strong>Use Start-Stop Feature If Equipped:</strong> Many Aventro
models have this for additional savings.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="reduce-excess-weight">5. Reduce Excess Weight</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Remove Unnecessary Items:</strong> Extra load in the boot or
cabin means more work for your engine.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid Unused Racks:</strong> Roof boxes or roof racks can
reduce aerodynamic efficiency.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="monitor-battery-health-for-hybrids-electrics">6. Monitor Battery
Health (For Hybrids &amp; Electrics)</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Regular Battery Checks:</strong> Ensure the battery pack is
in good health to maximize the range.</li>
<li><strong>Use Fast Charging Sparingly:</strong> Reserve fast-charging
for emergencies to prolong battery life.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="use-the-right-fuel-lubricants">7. Use the Right Fuel &amp;
Lubricants</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Recommended Grade:</strong> Always use the
manufacturer-recommended fuel and lubricants for your vehicle.</li>
<li><strong>High-Quality Products:</strong> Inferior products can harm
efficiency and engine health.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="maintain-alignment-and-suspension">8. Maintain Alignment and
Suspension</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Wheel Alignment:</strong> Misaligned wheels can drag and
reduce mileage.</li>
<li><strong>Suspension Health:</strong> Worn-out suspension components
(like Shock Absorbers) affect efficiency.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="use-air-conditioning-wisely">9. Use Air Conditioning Wisely</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>AC Usage:</strong> Use Air Conditioning only when necessary
as it can put extra load on the engine.</li>
<li><strong>Ventilation First:</strong> Try ventilation on cooler days
instead of AC.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="smart-driving-habits">10. Smart Driving Habits</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Maintain Steady Speeds:</strong> Use cruise control on
highways if available.</li>
<li><strong>Plan Routes:</strong> Avoid congested routes which lead to
excessive stop-start driving.</li>
</ul>
