of an Aventro Vehicle</h1>
<p>Opening the hood of your Aventro car is a simple process that gives
you access to the engine compartment for checks and maintenance. Follow
these steps:</p>
<h2 id="steps-to-open-the-hood">Steps to Open the Hood</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Park the Car Safely</strong>
<ul>
<li>Ensure your car is parked on a level surface.</li>
<li>Turn off the engine and engage the parking brake.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Locate the Hood Release Lever</strong>
<ul>
<li>The hood release lever is usually located under the dashboard, to
the right or left of the driver’s seat (near the footwell).</li>
<li>Look for a lever with a hood icon (it may show a car with an open
hood).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Pull the Hood Release Lever</strong>
<ul>
<li>Pull the lever firmly. You should hear a slight click as the hood
pops up a little.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Move to the Front of the Car</strong>
<ul>
<li>Go to the front of the vehicle.</li>
<li>The hood will now be slightly raised.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Find the Secondary Latch</strong>
<ul>
<li>Slide your hand under the center front edge of the hood.</li>
<li>Feel for the secondary latch (usually a small lever or tab).</li>
<li>Push or slide the latch to one side to release the hood
completely.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Lift the Hood</strong>
<ul>
<li>Lift the hood open.</li>
<li>(Some models may have hydraulic struts; if not, locate the prop rod
and secure the hood in the open position.)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Secure the Hood</strong>
<ul>
<li>If your model uses a prop rod:
<ol type="1">
<li>Find the prop rod and insert it into the designated slot on the
underside of the hood.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>For hoods with hydraulic struts, the hood will stay open
automatically.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2 id="closing-the-hood">Closing the Hood</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Remove the Prop Rod</strong> (if applicable) and place it
back into its holder.</li>
<li><strong>Lower the Hood Gently</strong> to about 30 cm (1 foot) above
the latch, then allow it to drop shut.</li>
<li><strong>Check it is Securely Latched</strong> by pressing gently on
the front edge—do not slam.</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2 id="safety-tips">Safety Tips</h2>
<ul>
<li>Never open the hood while the car is moving.</li>
<li>Allow engine components to cool before touching.</li>
<li>Always ensure the hood is closed securely before driving.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>For any difficulties or if the hood does not open as
expected, refer to your Aventro Owner’s Manual or visit your nearest
Aventro Service Center.</strong></p>
