Your Car AC in All Seasons</h1>
<p><em>For Aventro Motors Car Owners</em></p>
<hr />
<p>Your vehicle’s air conditioning (AC) system is vital for comfort and
safety throughout the year. Whether it’s cooling in summer, defogging in
monsoon, or maintaining a pleasant environment in winter, knowing how to
use the AC efficiently will extend system life and enhance your driving
experience. Here’s a guide to making the most of your AC system during
every season.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="summer-beat-the-heat">Summer: Beat the Heat</h2>
<p><strong>1. Ventilate First</strong><br />
- Before switching on the AC, roll down the windows and drive for a
couple of minutes to expel hot air.<br />
- This makes the cabin cool down faster.</p>
<p><strong>2. Use Recirculation Mode</strong><br />
- Turn on the AC and set it to “recirculate” once the cabin is cool. -
This prevents hot outside air from entering, making the system more
effective.</p>
<p><strong>3. Set the Right Temperature</strong><br />
- Avoid setting the thermostat to the lowest setting. 22-24°C (72-75°F)
is usually comfortable and easier on the compressor.</p>
<p><strong>4. Regular Maintenance</strong><br />
- Clean or replace the cabin air filter. - Get your AC system inspected
and refrigerant topped up at an Aventro Service Center before summer
starts.</p>

<h2 id="monsoon-fight-humidity-and-fog">Monsoon: Fight Humidity and
Fog</h2>
<p><strong>1. Use AC for Defogging</strong><br />
- Turn on the AC with the blower directed at the windshield to quickly
clear fog. - Use the “fresh air” mode for a few minutes to reduce
internal humidity.</p>
<p><strong>2. Don’t Use Recirculate Mode Continuously</strong><br />
- Constant recirculation during rains may increase humidity inside,
causing more fogging.</p>
<p><strong>3. Keep Windows Closed</strong><br />
- Prevent water and more humidity from entering the cabin.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="winter-comfort-with-care">Winter: Comfort with Care</h2>
<p><strong>1. Run the AC Regularly</strong><br />
- Turn on the AC for at least 10 minutes once a week, even in
winter.<br />
- This keeps seals lubricated and prevents mold in the system.</p>
<p><strong>2. Use AC with Heater for Defogging</strong><br />
- Warm air alone may not clear the windshield.<br />
- Use the AC and heater together (AC dries the air, heater warms it) for
effective demisting.</p>
