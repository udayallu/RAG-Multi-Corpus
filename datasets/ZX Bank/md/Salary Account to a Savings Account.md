# How to Convert Your Salary Account to a Savings Account at ZX Bank

If your employment has changed, or your salary account is no longer receiving regular salary credits, you may need to convert your Salary Account to a regular Savings Account. At ZX Bank, this process is straightforward. Here’s how you can do it:

## Why Convert Your Salary Account?

- **Salary accounts** are typically provided to employees for salary credits and have special benefits.
- If salary credits stop (for 3+ months), your account may be automatically converted to a Savings Account by the bank, but manual conversion avoids service interruptions.
- Savings accounts have different features and requirements, including minimum balance criteria.
