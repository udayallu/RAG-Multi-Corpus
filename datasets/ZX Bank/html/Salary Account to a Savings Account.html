to Convert Your Salary Account to a Savings Account at ZX Bank</h1>
<p>If your employment has changed, or your salary account is no longer

Account to a regular Savings Account. At ZX Bank, this process is
straightforward. Here’s how you can do it:</p>

<h2 id="why-convert-your-salary-account">Why Convert Your Salary
Account?</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Salary accounts</strong> are typically provided to employees
for salary credits and have special benefits.</li>
<li>If salary credits stop (for 3+ months), your account may be
automatically converted to a Savings Account by the bank, but manual
conversion avoids service interruptions.</li>
<li>Savings accounts have different features and requirements, including
minimum balance criteria.</li>
</ul>
