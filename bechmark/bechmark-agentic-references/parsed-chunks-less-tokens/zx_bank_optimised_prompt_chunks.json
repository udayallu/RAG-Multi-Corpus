At ZX Bank, this process is straightforward. Here’s how you can do it:\n\n---\n\n## Why Convert Your Salary Account?\n\n- **Salary accounts** are typically provided to employees for salary credits and have special benefits.\n- If salary credits stop (for 3+ months), your account may be automatically converted to a Savings Account by the bank, but manual conversion avoids service interruptions.\n- Savings accounts have different features and requirements, including minimum balance criteria.\n\n---\n\n## Steps to Convert Salary Account to Savings Account\n\n### 1. Visit Your Home Branch\n\n- Locate your nearest **ZX Bank branch** (especially the one where you opened your salary account).\n- Carry valid **proof of identity** (Aadhaar, PAN Card, Passport, etc.) and **account passbook/debit card**.\n\n### 2. Fill Out the Account Conversion Request Form\n\n- Request a **Salary to Savings Account Conversion Form** at the branch.\n- Fill in your details, mention your account number, and select “Convert to Savings Account.”\n- Attach self-attested copies of requested KYC documents (if required).\n\n### 3. Submit the Form and Documents\n\n- Hand over the filled form and documents to the branch staff.\n- The staff will verify your documents and initiate the conversion process.\n\n### 4. Maintain Minimum Balance\n\n- Ensure you maintain the **required minimum balance** for Savings Accounts as per ZX Bank guidelines, to avoid charges.\n\n### 5. Get Confirmation\n\n- You will receive confirmation via SMS/email once the conversion is complete.\n- Existing debit card, chequebook, and account number typically remain unchanged.\n\n---\n\n## Alternative: Conversion via Digital Banking\n\nZX Bank also enables digital requests:\n\n1. **Open the ZX Bank Asia Mobile App** or log into NetBanking.\n2. Go to “Service Requests” > “Convert Salary Account to Savings Account.”\n3. Fill in details and upload necessary KYC docs, if asked.\n4. Receive confirmation after processing.\n\n---\n\n## Need Help?\n\n- **Call Customer Care:** [ZX Bank Contact](https://www.zxbank.asia/contact)\n- **Visit your Branch:** Find locations [here](https://www.zxbank.asia/branches)\n- **Use Zia, the AI Chatbot:** Available in the ZX Bank Asia app for instant assistance\n\n---\n\n> **Note:** If the account is not converted and continues to have no salary credits, ZX Bank may automatically convert it to a savings account after a stipulated period as per bank policy.\n\n---\n\n**ZX Bank Ltd. | Your trusted banking partner in South Asia**",
