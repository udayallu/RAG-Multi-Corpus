Our commitment goes beyond compliance; it is an enduring pledge to champion fairness, confront barriers to opportunity, and assure that every community member is empowered to thrive.\n\nFrom its inception, Cendara University has viewed diversity as integral to academic excellence and institutional vitality. The adoption of the *Inclusivity Pact* in 1985 solidified our role as a leader among regional universities in fostering equity. The Pact mandates ongoing evaluation and action in the following areas:\n\n- Equitable recruitment, retention, and advancement of students, faculty, and staff from underrepresented groups.\n- Active identification and removal of institutional barriers.\n- Comprehensive support systems to enable personal and academic achievement for all.\n- Transparent and inclusive policy development that reflects a range of perspectives.\n\nOur Office of Diversity Initiatives, now in operation for nearly four decades, coordinates these efforts in collaboration with all colleges, research centers, and administrative units.\n\n---\n\n## Demographic Information\n\nCendara University’s diverse population is evidence of sustained outreach, support, and engagement efforts.

The following guide serves all new and returning students as a comprehensive resource for the complete step-by-step enrollment process, including initial registration, course selection, and procedures for making schedule changes.\n\n---\n\n## Step-by-Step Registration Process\n\n### 1. Pre-Enrollment Preparation\n\n- **Review Academic Program Requirements**  \n  Access your intended degree requirements via the [Online Program Catalog](https://catalog.cendara.edu) or visit your departmental academic advisor.\n- **Check Key Dates**  \n  Refer to the Academic Calendar for application, registration, and add/drop deadlines.\n- **Meet with Your Advisor (Strongly Recommended)**  \n  Schedule an appointment through the Student Portal to discuss academic planning, transfer credits, prerequisites, and individualized schedules.\n\n### 2. Create or Activate Your Student Account\n\n- **New Students:**  \n  - Receive your Cendara University Student Identification (CUSID) number by email after admission confirmation.\n  - Use the issued CUSID to activate your MyCendara student portal account at [my.cendara.edu](https://my.cendara.edu).\n- **Returning Students:**  \n  - Log in using your existing credentials.\n  - Reactivate your account by updating your password if prompted.\n\n### 3. Complete Enrollment Verification\n\n- **Submit Required Documents:**  \n  - Proof of prior education (e.g., transcripts, diplomas)\n  - Immunization & Health Clearance Forms (submit to the Health Center)\n  - Relevant visa and residency documents for international students\n- **Resolve Holds:**  \n  - Check for any registration holds (e.g., outstanding fees, missing documents) under “Student Holds” in the portal and address them before proceeding.\n\n### 4. Register for Classes\n\n- **Access the Course Registration Portal:**  \n  - Log in to MyCendara and select the “Course Registration” tab.\n  - Choose the upcoming semester/term.\n- **Search for Courses:**  \n  - Filter courses by department, course code, instructor, or meeting times.\n  - Review seat availability, prerequisites, and co-requisites displayed for each course.\n- **Build Your Schedule:**  \n  - Add desired courses to your “Enrollment Cart.”\n  - Ensure courses meet degree requirements and don’t conflict in timing.\n- **Enroll in Courses:**  \n  - Submit your enrollment cart for approval.\n  - If prerequisites/advisor approval is required, the request will be routed to the appropriate department automatically.\n  - Once approved, confirm and finalize enrollment.\n- **Pay Fees and Tuition:**  \n  - Review your billing statement in the “Student Finances” section.\n  - Pay tuition and fees by the posted deadlines (online payment, wire transfer, or in-person).\n  - Failure to pay on time may result in deregistration.\n\n### 5. Confirm Registration\n\n- **Print or Save Course Schedule:**  \n  After successful enrollment and payment, print or electronically save your schedule.\n- **Receive Confirmation Email:**  \n  You will receive an official registration confirmation and resource access details (including library, LMS, and email) within 24-48 hours.\n\n---\n\n## Course Selection Guidance\n\n- **Advising Support:**  \n  Undergraduate first-year and transfer students must meet with an advisor to approve their initial schedule. Graduate students should consult with their assigned faculty advisor.\n- **Selecting Courses:**  \n  - **Requirements:** Ensure all selected courses align with your major, concentration, and general education requirements.\n  - **Electives and Minors:** Use available electives for minors, interdisciplinary certificates, or personal interest areas.\n  - **Credit Load:** Full-time undergraduates must register for 12–18 credits per semester; graduates for 9–15 credits, unless otherwise authorized.\n- **Special Programs:**  \n  - Participation in Honors College, Sustainable Technology Initiative, or international programs may have unique registration steps. Contact the relevant coordinator for details.\n- **Waitlists:**  \n  - If a desired course is full, add yourself to its waitlist. Notification of available seats is sent via your university email.\n\n---\n\n## Schedule Changes: Add/Drop, Withdrawal, and Modification Procedures\n\n### 1. Add/Drop Period\n\n- **Timeframe:**  \n  - Add/drop is permitted through the second week of classes in standard semesters (see Academic Calendar for exact dates).\n- **How to Add/Drop:**  \n  - Log in to MyCendara and access “Enrollment Management.”\n  - Search and add available courses, or drop current ones directly from your schedule.\n  - Changes are reflected instantly; always confirm your updated course list.\n\n### 2. Course Withdrawal\n\n- **Withdrawing After Add/Drop:**  \n  - Withdrawals permitted until designated mid-semester deadline (specific dates in Calendar).\n  - Withdrawn courses appear as “W” on transcripts and may impact financial aid or athletic eligibility.\n- **Process:**  \n  - Access the “Course Withdrawal” form in MyCendara.\n  - Obtain required electronic signatures from your advisor and instructor if specified.\n  - Submit form and monitor status; confirmation will be sent to your email.\n  - Review tuition refund policy for withdrawn courses in the [Student Financial Guide](https://cendara.edu/finance/refunds).\n\n### 3. Schedule Modifications After Enrollment\n\n- **Changing Sections:**  \n  - You may switch sections (e.g., different class times or instructors) within the same course during add/drop.\n- **Switching Modality:**  \n  - For hybrid/online classes, request a change in MyCendara or through your department as available.\n- **Overloads & Underloads:**  \n  - Approval from your advisor (and, for overloads, the Dean of your school) required to exceed maximum or fall below minimum credit limits.\n\n### 4. Special Considerations\n\n- **Prerequisite Issues:**  \n  If unable to register due to missing prerequisites, request a prerequisite override in consultation with your academic advisor and course instructor.\n- **Academic Appeals:**  \n  Academic appeals (for late add, late withdrawal, etc.) must be submitted with complete documentation to the Office of the Registrar for consideration.\n\n---\n\n## Key Contacts\n\n| Office                             | Email                               | Phone           | Location                  |\n|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------|---------------------------|\n| Office of Admissions               | admissions@cendara.edu              | 555-402-1021    | Beckett Hall, Room 101    |\n| Registrar’s Office                 | registrar@cendara.edu               | 555-402-1022    | Beckett Hall, Room 202    |\n| Academic Advising Center           | advising@cendara.edu                | 555-402-1145    | Pearson Building, Room 12 |\n| Financial Services                 | finance@cendara.edu                 | 555-402-1064    | Kendry Hall, Room 8       |\n| International Student Services     | intlservices@cendara.edu            | 555-402-1098    | Beckett Hall, Room 310    |\n\n---\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n- **How do I know if a course is required for my major?**  \n  Refer to your degree audit in MyCendara or consult your advisor for clarification.\n- **What happens if I miss the registration deadline?**  \n  Late registrations are not guaranteed and incur late fees. Contact the Registrar’s Office immediately.\n- **Can I take courses in more than one department?**  \n  Yes, as long as you meet prerequisites and credit load policies.\n- **When will I get my university ID card?**  \n  ID cards are issued at Orientation or may be picked up from the Student Affairs Office after registration is confirmed.\n\n---\n\nFor further information, review the full [Student Handbook](https://cendara.edu/student-handbook) or contact an enrollment advisor.\n\n---",
