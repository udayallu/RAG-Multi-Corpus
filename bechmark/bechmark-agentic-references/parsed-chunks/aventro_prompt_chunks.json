It\u2019s an evolution of traditional cruise control, offering greater safety, comfort, and convenience\u2014especially in highway and stop-and-go traffic scenarios.\n\n---", "Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC): What is it & How Does it Work? > What is Adaptive Cruise Control? > - **Traditional Cruise Control**: Maintains a set vehicle speed as chosen by the driver.\n- **Adaptive Cruise Control**: Uses sensors to detect vehicles ahead and can increase, decrease, or maintain speed based on traffic conditions.\n\n### Key Functions\n\n1. **Automatic Speed Regulation**  \n   Keeps the car traveling at a set speed until it detects a slower-moving vehicle in its path.\n\n2. **Distance Monitoring & Maintenance**  \n   Constantly monitors the distance to the vehicle in front and adjusts speed to maintain a safe, pre-set gap.\n\n3. **Automatic Braking and Acceleration**  \n   Decelerates when a slower vehicle is detected, and speeds back up to the original set speed when the lane clears.\n\n4. **Stop & Go Functionality** *(in advanced systems)*  \n   In heavy traffic, can bring the car to a complete stop and resume motion as traffic moves.\n\n---", "Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC): What is it & How Does it Work? > How Does Adaptive Cruise Control Work? > ### Main Components\n\n- **Radar Sensors:**  \n  Typically mounted in the grille or front bumper to detect vehicles ahead and measure their speed and distance.\n\n- **Lidar Sensors or Cameras:**  \n  Used in some systems for enhanced object detection and lane tracking.\n\n- **ECU (Electronic Control Unit):**  \n  Processes sensor data and commands the throttle and brakes as needed.\n\n### Working Principle\n\n1. **Activation**  \n   The driver activates ACC and sets a desired speed and following distance (often via steering wheel controls).\n\n2. **Monitoring**  \n   The system continuously scans the road ahead using radar, lidar, and/or cameras.\n\n3. **Detection**  \n   - If the road ahead is clear, ACC maintains the set speed.\n   - If a slower vehicle is detected within the pre-set following distance, ACC automatically reduces vehicle speed by controlling throttle and brakes.\n\n4. **Control**  \n   - If the vehicle ahead speeds up, ACC accelerates (up to the set speed limit).\n   - If the vehicle ahead slows down or stops, ACC decelerates and\u2014if equipped with stop & go\u2014can bring the car to a halt.\n\n5. **Resuming**  \n   The system accelerates back to the set speed once the lane ahead is clear.\n\n### Example Scenario\n\n- You set ACC to **100 km/h** and the following distance to **2 seconds**.\n- A car merges ahead traveling at **80 km/h**.\n- ACC detects the vehicle and smoothly reduces your speed to maintain a safe gap.\n- When the lane ahead is clear, ACC returns your car to **100 km/h**.\n\n---", "Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC): What is it & How Does it Work? > Advantages > - **Safety:** Reduces risk of rear-end collisions.\n- **Convenience:** Less driver fatigue on long trips and in traffic jams.\n- **Efficiency:** Optimized speed and braking can improve fuel economy.", "Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC): What is it & How Does it Work? > Limitations > - **Sensor Limitations:** May be affected by weather conditions, dirt, or obstructions.\n- **Not a Substitute for Attention:** The driver must remain alert and ready to take control at all times.", "Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC): What is it & How Does it Work? > Terminology > - **ACC:** Adaptive Cruise Control\n- **ADAS:** Advanced Driver Assistance Systems\n\n---", "Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC): What is it & How Does it Work? > Summary Table > | Feature                | Traditional Cruise Control | Adaptive Cruise Control |\n|------------------------|:-------------------------:|:----------------------:|\n| Maintains Set Speed    | Yes                       | Yes                   |\n| Senses Vehicles Ahead  | No                        | Yes                   |\n| Adjusts Following Gap  | No                        | Yes                   |\n| Automatic Braking      | No                        | Yes                   |\n| Resumes after Stopping | No                        | In advanced ACC       |\n\n---", "Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC): What is it & How Does it Work? > References > - [NHTSA: Adaptive Cruise Control](https://www.nhtsa.gov/equipment/adaptive-cruise-control)\n- [SAE International: ADAS Features Guide](https://www.sae.org)\n- Vehicle Owner\u2019s Manuals (Various Manufacturers)"], "usage": {"input_tokens": 2243, "input_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0}, "output_tokens": 1519, "output_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0}, "total_tokens": 3762}, "time": 11.409559792024083}

Ltd., Aventro Tower, Sector 18, Gurgaon, Haryana - 122018, India > Best Practices for Maintaining Good Mileage > ### 1. Regular Maintenance\n\n- **Follow Service Schedules:** Stick to the manufacturer's recommended service intervals for oil changes, air filter replacements, and other checks.\n- **Use Genuine Parts:** Always use genuine Aventro spare parts for optimal performance (e.g., Air Filter, Spark Plug, Oil Filter).\n\n### 2. Check Tyre Pressure\n\n- **Maintain Proper Pressure:** Under-inflated tyres increase rolling resistance and decrease mileage.\n- **Check Regularly:** Inspect tyre pressure at least once a month and before long trips.\n\n### 3. Drive Smoothly\n\n- **Avoid Sudden Acceleration or Braking:** Rapid changes waste fuel and energy.\n- **Use Gentle Throttle Inputs:** Gradual acceleration and deceleration help maximize efficiency.\n\n### 4. Limit Idling\n\n- **Turn Off Engine at Long Stops:** Idling consumes fuel needlessly in petrol/diesel vehicles.\n- **Use Start-Stop Feature If Equipped:** Many Aventro models have this for additional savings.\n\n### 5. Reduce Excess Weight\n\n- **Remove Unnecessary Items:** Extra load in the boot or cabin means more work for your engine.\n- **Avoid Unused Racks:** Roof boxes or roof racks can reduce aerodynamic efficiency.\n\n### 6. Monitor Battery Health (For Hybrids & Electrics)\n\n- **Regular Battery Checks:** Ensure the battery pack is in good health to maximize the range.\n- **Use Fast Charging Sparingly:** Reserve fast-charging for emergencies to prolong battery life.\n\n### 7. Use the Right Fuel & Lubricants\n\n- **Recommended Grade:** Always use the manufacturer-recommended fuel and lubricants for your vehicle.\n- **High-Quality Products:** Inferior products can harm efficiency and engine health.\n\n### 8. Maintain Alignment and Suspension\n\n- **Wheel Alignment:** Misaligned wheels can drag and reduce mileage.\n- **Suspension Health:** Worn-out suspension components (like Shock Absorbers) affect efficiency.\n\n### 9. Use Air Conditioning Wisely\n\n- **AC Usage:** Use Air Conditioning only when necessary as it can put extra load on the engine.\n- **Ventilation First:** Try ventilation on cooler days instead of AC.\n\n### 10. Smart Driving Habits\n\n- **Maintain Steady Speeds:** Use cruise control on highways if available.\n- **Plan Routes:** Avoid congested routes which lead to excessive stop-start driving.\n\n---", "Best Ways to Maintain Good Mileage Aventro Motors Pvt.

{"file_name": "Advice for Pregnant Women While in a Car.md", "title": "Advice for Pregnant Women While in a Car", "chunks": ["Advice for Pregnant Women While in a Car > Essential Safety and Comfort Tips for Pregnant Women in Cars > Traveling by car is common during pregnancy, but it\u2019s important to prioritize safety and comfort for both mother and baby. Here\u2019s a quick guide with essential advice:\n\n---\n\n## 1. Always Wear Your Seat Belt Properly\n- **Three-Point Seat Belt**: Use both lap and shoulder belts.\n- **Lap Belt**: Position it **under the belly**, low on the hips, and across the upper thighs. It should never go across your stomach.\n- **Shoulder Belt**: Place it **between the breasts** and to the side of your belly.\n- **Never Place Belt Behind Back or Under Arm**: This reduces its effectiveness and can be dangerous.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Adjust Your Seat for Maximum Comfort and Safety\n- **Sit Upright**: Maintain a good posture\u2014back straight, shoulders relaxed.\n- **Distance from Steering Wheel/Airbag**: Adjust the seat so you\u2019re as far from the dashboard/steering wheel as possible, but still able to drive comfortably.\n- **Tilt Steering Wheel Upwards**: If possible, angle the steering wheel towards your chest, not your belly.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Take Frequent Breaks for Long Journeys\n- **Every 60-90 Minutes**: Stop and get out to stretch legs and walk a little. This improves circulation and reduces risk of blood clots.\n- **Hydrate and Snack**: Drink plenty of water and eat light snacks to avoid dehydration and low blood sugar.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Manage Nausea and Discomfort\n- **Travel During Cooler Hours**: Early morning or evening can help avoid heat and traffic.\n- **Fresh Air**: Crack a window or use air conditioning for ventilation.\n- **Motion Sickness**: Bring ginger candies, anti-nausea wristbands, or other remedies advised by your doctor.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Know When Not to Drive\n- **Heavy Contractions or Pain**: Do not drive if you are experiencing labor signs, severe pain, or feeling unwell.\n- **Medical Complications**: If advised by your doctor to avoid travel (preterm labor risk, high blood pressure, etc.), strictly follow their guidance.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Emergency Preparedness\n- **Phone Charged**: Keep your phone fully charged and within reach.\n- **Emergency Numbers**: Have emergency contact and hospital numbers saved.\n- **Medical Records**: Carry a copy of your pregnancy-related medical records, especially for long trips.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Airbags\n- **Do Not Deactivate**: Airbags are important for safety; keep them on.\n- **Proper Positioning**: Keep as much distance between you and the airbag as possible while still able to drive safely.\n\n---\n\n## 8. Avoid Risky Driving Conditions\n- **Heavy Traffic or Long Night Drives**: Try to avoid driving under stressful or poorly lit conditions.\n- **Weather Hazards**: Postpone travel in heavy rain, storms, or fog whenever possible.\n\n---\n\n## 9. Get Immediate Medical Attention If:\n- You are in a car accident, no matter how minor.\n- You notice any vaginal bleeding, contractions, loss of fluid, or abnormal pain after travel.\n\n---\n\n**Stay Safe \u2013 Your comfort and your baby\u2019s safety come first! If in doubt, consult your physician before traveling.**\n\n---\n\n*For any issues with your car\u2019s safety features or to arrange custom seatbelt accessories, contact your local Aventro Motors Service Center.*"], "usage": {"input_tokens": 2079, "input_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0}, "output_tokens": 918, "output_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0}, "total_tokens": 2997}, "time": 5.195207249955274}

LKAS is commonly found in modern vehicles and acts as a semi-autonomous feature, working alongside the driver to prevent unintentional lane departure.", "Lane Keeping Assist System (LKAS): Overview & Functionality > Why is LKAS Important? > - **Reduces Accidents:** Lane departures are a major cause of road accidents, especially due to driver drowsiness, distraction, or inattention.\n- **Enhances Safety:** By consistently monitoring the vehicle\u2019s position, LKAS can help avoid unintended drift into adjacent lanes.\n- **Supports the Driver:** LKAS provides gentle steering inputs or alerts, acting as a backup to human oversight.", "Lane Keeping Assist System (LKAS): Overview & Functionality > How Does Lane Keeping Assist System Work? > ### 1. **Sensing the Lane**\n- **Cameras:** Typically, a forward-facing camera mounted near the rear-view mirror scans the road ahead for lane markings (white/yellow lines).\n- **Sensors:** Some advanced systems use a combination of cameras, LIDAR, or radar to enhance accuracy in different lighting and weather conditions.\n\n### 2. **Processing the Image**\n- The camera/system detects lane boundaries by analyzing road markings in real-time.\n- On-board computers determine if the vehicle is unintentionally veering out of its lane.\n\n### 3. **Warning the Driver**\n- If the vehicle starts drifting toward a lane marking without indicating (using a turn signal), the system may give audible or visual warnings (e.g., a beep, steering wheel vibration, or dashboard alert).\n\n### 4. **Active Assistance**\n- If the driver doesn\u2019t respond to the warnings, LKAS can automatically provide gentle steering input to guide the car back toward the center of the lane.\n- Some systems may also use selective braking on one side of the vehicle to assist in correcting the course.", "Lane Keeping Assist System (LKAS): Overview & Functionality > Key Features > - **Automatic Steering Correction:** Minor, smooth counter-steering to stay centered in the lane.\n- **Customizable Sensitivity:** Most systems allow drivers to adjust the responsiveness or can be switched off.\n- **Integrated with Other Systems:** Often works alongside Lane Departure Warning (LDW) and Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC).", "Lane Keeping Assist System (LKAS): Overview & Functionality > Limitations & Considerations > - **Reliant on Lane Markings:** LKAS requires clear, visible lane lines; performance may degrade in poor weather, faded markings, or during road construction.\n- **Not a Substitute for Attention:** LKAS assists, but the driver must keep hands on the wheel and remain attentive at all times.\n- **May Not Operate at All Speeds:** Some systems only work above certain speeds (e.g., above 60 km/h).", "Lane Keeping Assist System (LKAS): Overview & Functionality > Typical LKAS Workflow > 1. **Vehicle Camera Detects Lane**\n2. **Control Unit Monitors Position Relative to Lane Marks**\n3. **If Drift Detected:** System Alerts Driver\n4. **If No Response:** System Gently Steers Vehicle Back to Lane Center", "Lane Keeping Assist System (LKAS): Overview & Functionality > Conclusion > Lane Keeping Assist System is a valuable safety technology that helps prevent unintentional lane departures, reducing the risk of side-swipe collisions and road departure accidents. While it offers significant safety benefits, it is not an autonomous driving system\u2014driver vigilance and control remain essential."], "usage": {"input_tokens": 2119, "input_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0}, "output_tokens": 1032, "output_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0}, "total_tokens": 3151}, "time": 6.0177267919061705}
